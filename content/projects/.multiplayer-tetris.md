## Project Description

After completing my first computer science course at university, I wanted to test my knowledge by making a simple game. At that time, one of my favourite games to play was playing multiplayer Tetris on my Nintendo Switch and it seemed to be doable with the skillset I had at the time. The code quality written for this was definitely not my finest work but I was quite satisified with the outcomes of this project given how new I was to programming.
