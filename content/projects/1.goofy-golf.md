## Project Description

Goofy Golf was a group project as part of the COMP3421 Computer Graphics course at UNSW. The course mainly orients towards PC game development with brief touches on introductory VR topics. The project is to be completed as a group of 4 members where the main requirement is to produce a game using Unreal Engine that is both engaging and novel.

The main theme of the game is mini-golf with cartoon graphics where the ultimate goal of the game is to putt the ball into the hole at the end of the course.

Take a look at our game trailer.
