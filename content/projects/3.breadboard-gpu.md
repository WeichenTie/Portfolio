## Project Description
This was a project that I decided to do on a whim during my summer break over 2021 after complete a digital circuits course in university. It is a breadboard computer that was build following the guidance of youtuber Ben Eater and his homemade graphics card series.

It was a great way for learning the subtle intricacies of electronics engineering and also learning how to interpret datasheets.

## Features

The graphics card I decided to build was slightly different to the one from Ben Eater mainly because I wanted to challenge myself and test my overall understanding of the content.

## Results
Due to time and money constraints, I was forced to stop development on the project though I do plan to pick it back up again someday (or maybe redo this project with proper PCBs instead of breadboards). I think this would be after I graduate university and learn some new electrical circuit design tricks and theories to streamline the whole process.

Overall I was very impressed with the progress that I made over a few short weeks especially being a complete beginner to electronics engineering.
