## Project Description

This was a project that I decided to do on a whim during my summer break over 2021 after complete a digital circuits course in university. It is a breadboard computer that was build following the guidance of youtuber Ben Eater and his homemade graphics card series.

It was a great way for learning the subtle intricacies of electronics engineering and also learning how to interpret datasheets.

In case you would like to check out his series below,

This project involved extensive use of breadboards, digital circuits, and datasheets for different components.

The main technologies used in this project included TTL ICs, diodes, capacitors, resistors, and most importantly, a VGA connector for output. I also utilized C++ for generating writing my own naïve graphics API and other necessary digital logic.

## Technologies Used

## Features

The graphics card I decided to build was slightly different to the one from Ben Eater mainly because I wanted to challenge myself and test my overall understanding of the content.

By following Ben Eater’s guide, I was quickly able to build the bare minimum breadboard setup for displaying simple RGB bands on the monitor. This verified that my circuit was functional.

## Rendering a Static Image

The next step would be to render a static image to the screen. Once again, I followed Ben’s tutorial on a making a EEPROM writer and used the following his python code to generate the necessary binary to load into the EEPROM.

After connecting the EEPROM to my GPU, I was greeted with this result:

## GPU Buffer

Now since I wanted to practice on my soldering skills, I designed my own PCB and had it fabricated by JLCPCB for the GPU buffer and after some trial and error, this is what I ended up with.

## Driver

The main computing unit for this graphics card was AT-MEGA32 microcontroller. Although it may seem like cheating using a microcontroller, I was swiftly burning through my savings which

After some research, it came to my attention that the digital input and outputs function were too slow for my needs since they only operated on one pin at a time and needed to check for valid inputs. As such, I will be writing my own C function to accomplish the task with zero overhead using port manipulation. This allowed me to dramatically improve the time to write from 2.24us for a single bit to 23ns for 8 bits in parallel.

Since I was really into Tetris at the time, I wanted to pay homage to that game by including it into this GPU. However unfortunately, due to some time constraints and other commitments I was not able to complete this project but these are the current results.

## Results

Although, due to time and financial constraints, I had to halt development on the project. However, I plan to resume it someday, possibly after graduating from university when I might have a few more electrical circuit design tricks up my sleeve to streamline the process. Alternatively, I may choose to redo the project using proper PCBs instead of breadboards. Despite the abrupt halt, I was quite pleased with the progress I made in just a few weeks, especially considering I was a beginner in electronics engineering.
