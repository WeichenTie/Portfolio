# Slime Simulation

## Project Description

My first attempt at GPGPU, simulating the acellular slime mold species, Physarum polycephalum. The main goal is to demonstrate how complexity in life can arise from following a few simple rules.

This attempt was heavily inspired by Sebastian Lague's coding adventure "Ant & Slime Simulations".
