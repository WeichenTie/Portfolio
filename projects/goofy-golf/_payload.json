I utilised my knowledge of linear transformations and the underlying rendering pipeline to make the power bar scale with the power and to always be at the top-most layer. Furthermore, I used a state machine pattern to determine the ball's behaviour for each game tick. The reason for this approach was so it was easier for us when we wanted to have certain power-ups interact with the ball and minimised friction when integrating with other group members code.\n",{"type":23,"tag":125,"props":126,"children":129},"blog-img",{"src":127,"alt":128},"/images/projects/golf/aiming.png","aiming the golf ball",[],{"type":38,"value":131},"\nThe ballistic missile item was mainly used by me as a stepping stone to understand how entity creation, physics and how its effects could be integrated with the ball behaviour script that I have previously wrote.

The ballistic missile works by applying an radial impulse force plus a constant upwards force to enemy players balls to blast them off track.
