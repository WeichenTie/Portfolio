I decided that the power meter from the game Golf with Your Friends would be the most visually appealing and intuitive. I utilised my knowledge of linear transformations and the underlying rendering pipeline to make the power bar scale with the power and to always be at the top-most layer. Furthermore, I used a state machine pattern to determine the ball's behaviour for each game tick. The reason for this approach was so it was easier for us when we wanted to have certain power-ups interact with the ball and minimised friction when integrating with other group members code.\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"blog-img","props":{"src":"/images/projects/golf/aiming.png","alt":"aiming the golf ball"},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe ballistic missile item was mainly used by me as a stepping stone to understand how entity creation, physics and how its effects could be integrated with the ball behaviour script that I have previously wrote. It also gave me an idea of complexities of my group members tasks so I could design the ball's behavioural code with ease of integration in mind. The ballistic missile works by applying an radial impulse force plus a constant upwards force to enemy players balls to blast them off track. By using Unreal's Blueprint's instigator property, I made it so that the player who used the missile was not affected by the explosion."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"blog-img","props":{"src":"/images/projects/golf/balistic.png","alt":"balistic missile prior to exploding"},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I also wanted to experiment with using shaders through the miss debuff item which blurs the screen, applies a rippled effect and drastically reduces the accuracy of the shot by causing aiming arrow to oscillate left and right using a noise function."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"blog-img","props":{"src":"/images/projects/golf/miss.png","alt":"miss debuff in action"},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"One thing that I noticed in one of my was the black hole's physical gravitational effect was very choppy as it was using lerp functions to teleport the ball.
